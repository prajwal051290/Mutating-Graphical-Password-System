Mutating graphical password system, as the name suggests is a password system based on graphical patterns. It requires the user to remember patterns rather than lengthy and tedious passwords. Also the password being mutating, 
the input changes at every login, eliminating the threats of traditional password attacks. Password being dependent on patterns rather than actual character values, it is very difficult to intercept the password. <br><br>
